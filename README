http-runner listens to http requests.
if it contains a dollar ("$") char, http-runner greps its config file for "_"+the word after "$".
if found, it asks (via Xdialog) if the alias should be run, and if yes, it runs the command specified 
in the config.
if not found, it greps for the word without "_", if found IT DOES NOT ASK, but run it.
if that was also not found, it asks for permission to execute the query directly as a bash command 
line.

the query without the first word (which is used as alias) is defined in $HTTP_RUNNER_REQUEST_ARGS.

config syntax: [_]alias bash command line
WARNING: if you specify "_test1", and user calls $test1, you get asked, but if he calls $_test1, you 
don't! so, always also specify a "__test1" with e.g. "echo forbidden", so it gets called if user 
requests $_test1 and $__test1.

url syntax: http://example.invalid/[any/path/]$[command line]
currently supported url encoded chars: space( ) and doublequotes(")


UPDATE: a magic cookie can be set by calling "$cake=<the-magic-cookie>", which has to be allowed in the dialog,
and will autoallow all later commands which have this cookie set.


oh, btw: I use this routed through fefe's gatling httpd, which works great for such tasks. (just -O 
'127.0.0.1/82/HTTP-RUN')
